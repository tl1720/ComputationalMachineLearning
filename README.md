 Files in patch_database_non_normalize are binary format. The content of every file contains a bunch of patch vectors for a image. I mainly wrote the image patch proessing, but the file formate processing(read/write) is done by my partner ChiaLing Wang. And I pull the folder patch_database_non_normalize to use.
